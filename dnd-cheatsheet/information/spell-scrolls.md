reference: Dungeon Master's Guide, page 200

- To use a spell scroll, the spell must be on your class's spell list
- A scroll can be used once, then crumbles
- Using the scroll
  - Doesn't require material components
  - Otherwise, is cast as normal
- If the spell is higher level than you can normally cast, make an Arcana check, DC `10 + spell level`
  - On a failure, the scroll is still consumed
- Spell save DC and attack bonus are determined by the scroll, not the caster
