- When you take the attack action, make multiple attacks
- The attacks don't have to target the same creature
- When making a multi-attack, you can move between the attacks, and split the attack between multiple targets.
- Multiple sources of multi-attack don't stack
- Grappling / shoving only takes one of your attacks
