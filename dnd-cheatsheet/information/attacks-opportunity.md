- Take a reaction when a creature moves out of your reach
  - Have to be able to see it
- If you have multiple reaches, any of them count
  - E.g. holding a whip in one hand (reach 10 ft.), and a sword in the other (5 ft.) you can make an opportunity attack when a creature moves out of 5 ft., or out of 10 ft.
- Take one melee attack
  - No multiattack
- Can't take the reaction if
  - They've used disengage
  - They've teleported
  - They've been moved by an external force
