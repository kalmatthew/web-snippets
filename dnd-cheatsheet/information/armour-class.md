title: Armor Class
reference: Player's Handbook, page 144

- Armor Class = AC
- Represents how hard a character is to be wounded in battle
  - It combines how armored they are with how good they are at dodging attacks
- A character may have multiple potential ACs (depending on class features etc), they choose which one to use
- Typical other sources of AC could be:
  - Wearing armor
  - Class features (E.g. a barbarian's _unarmored defence_)
  - Racial features (E.g. a lizardfolk's _natural armor_)
- If a character has no other sources of AC, then it's `10 + Dexterity modifier`
