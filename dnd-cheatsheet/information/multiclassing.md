- You can take levels in other classes when you level up
- There's a difference between character level, and your level in your classes
- Each class has ability score minimums
  - You also need to meet the prerequisite for your primary class
- When you pick a class for the first time
  - You gain _some_, but not all of the class proficiencies
- When you level up
  - Hit points / die are added based on the class you pick
  - Your proficiency bonus is based on your total character level
  - _Extra attacks_ - Doesn't stack
  - _Channel divinity_ - You get more options, but not more uses
  - Your cantrip effects are based on your total character level
- Spellcasting

  - Spells prepared
    - Prepare each class spell list separately for each class
    - Each spell associated with one of your classes
  - The spell bonus / DC for a spell is based on which class its prepared for
  - There's a separate table for how many spell slots you have, don't use the class-specific ones (warlock spell slots are separate)
  - _Warlocks_ - You can use pact magic slots for non-warlock spells, and regular spell slots for pact magic
