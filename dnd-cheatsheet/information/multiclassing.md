- When you level up
  - Hit points / die are added based on the class you pick
  - Your proficiency bonus is based on your total character level
  - _Multi-attack_ - Doesn't stack
  - _Channel divinity_ - You get more options, but not more uses
  - Your cantrip effects are based on your total character level
- Spellcasting
  - Spells prepared
    - Prepare each class spell list separately for each class
    - Each spell associated with one of your classes
    - The spell bonus / DC for a spell is based on which class its prepared for
  - There's a separate table for how many spell slots you have, don't use the class-specific ones (warlock spell slots are separate)
  - _Warlocks_ - You can use pact magic slots for non-warlock spells, and regular spell slots for pact magic
