reference:
  - Dungeon Master's Guide, page 141

- Casts at the lowest possible level
- This doesn't use a spell slot
- The spell requires no components, unless otherwise stated
- If the spell requires a spell casting ability (e.g. for a spell save DC), use your own
  - If you have multiple, pick one
  - If you don't have one, its `+0`, don't add proficiency
