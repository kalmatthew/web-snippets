title: Instant Death
reference: Player's Handbook, page 197

- _Can_ happen if you take more damage then would reduce you to 0 HP
- If the overflow damage exceeds your _maximum_ HP, you die instantly
  - No death saving throws
  - Skip going unconscious
- E.g. your character has `30` max HP, and takes `70` damage
  - It takes `30` points of damage to reduce your character to `0` HP
  - The remaining `40` is greater than your maximum, `30`, so your character dies
