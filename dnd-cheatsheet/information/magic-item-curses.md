title: Cursed Items
reference: Dungeon Master's Guide, page 138

In addition to their regular effects, some items have a hidden, negative effect associated with them.

The _identify_ spell doesn't pick up curses, or what their effects might be.

Cursed items cannot usually be voluntarily unattuned.
