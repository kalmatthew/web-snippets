reference: Player's Handbook, page 198

- To be mounted, a creature must by at least one size class bigger
- Attacks can target either the mount or the character
- Mounting or dismounting costs half your movement
- Falling off
  - Checks to remain mounted are a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw
  - This can be triggered by
    - The rider being knocked prone
    - The mount being forced to move
- Initiative
  - For a controlled mount, its initiative matches your's when you mount it
  - For an independent mount, it retains its place in initiative
- Attacks of Opportunity
  - When the mount provokes an attack of opportunity, the attack can target either the mount, or you
- Controlled mounts
  - E.g. horses
  - Can only Dash, Disengage, or Dodge
  - Can move and act on the turn they're mounted
